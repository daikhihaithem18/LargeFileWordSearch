# LargeFileWordSearch
The script can find matched words in very large files because it uses memory-mapped files, which allow it to efficiently search through files without loading the entire file into memory. 
This text filtering tool is particularly useful when dealing with exceptionally large text files that standard text editors, such as Notepad, struggle to open or manipulate.
